DESCRIPTION:

Task 3: IoT Security System

Objective: Build a basic IoT-based security system that detects motion using a PIR sensor and triggers an alert (LED/Buzzer), simulating a home or room intrusion detection system.

Weâ€™ll use:

PIR sensor â†’ To detect motion

LED/Buzzer â†’ To indicate alert

Serial Monitor â†’ To simulate alert messages
All on Wokwi (Arduino UNO)
